# Terms And Procrastination

## What it does

TAP is a Chrome extension that allows you to view a summary of the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the webpage you are currently visiting. We also keep a list of already allowed and blacklisted websites by the user for their viewing which reminds them why they may or may not have agreed with their data policies in the first place. Our text summarizer creates a significantly shorter (yet containing important information with keywords and quantitative figures) for a quick read for our user. The extension also provides key bullet points for the user which highlights the categories of the data and data type of the user a website might be accessing.
